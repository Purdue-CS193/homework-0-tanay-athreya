# Tanay Athreya's First CS193 Homework

- I think the teachers for CS 193 are well spoken and knowledgable about programming and computer science. I am able to understand them with ease.
- I like the people in the class. Lots of people from the Bay Area, California so I feel I can make friends pretty easily
- The class is stress free because of the way it is structured but I still feel like I am learning useful things.
